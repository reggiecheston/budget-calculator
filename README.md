Budget Tracker
Build a budget tracker using SASS, and JavaScript. Practice functions and object-oriented programming concepts by implementing a class, utilizing methods, and encapsulating functionality within objects.
Requirements:

1. User Interface
   - The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Include input fields to enter income and expense descriptions.
   - Provide input fields to enter income and expense amounts.
   - Add buttons to add income and expenses.
   - Display the total budget, income, and expenses on the UI.
2. Budget Calculation
   - The application should calculate the total budget based on the income and expenses entered by the user.
   - The total budget should be updated whenever a new income or expense is added.
   - The income and expenses should be stored in separate arrays or objects.
   - The application should correctly handle positive income and negative expenses.
3. Functionality
   - Implement the ability to add income by entering a description and amount.
   - Implement the ability to add expenses by entering a description and amount.
   - The application should prevent the user from submitting empty input fields or invalid amounts.
   - Provide proper validation and error handling for input fields.
4. Display Summary
   - Display the calculated income, expenses, and total budget on the UI.
   - The summary should be updated dynamically whenever a new income or expense is added.
5. Object-Oriented Programming:
   - Implement a Budget class with properties and methods to handle income, expenses, and total budget.
   - Encapsulate the budget-related functionality within the Budget class.
   - Utilize object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism in your implementation.
6. Testing:
   - Manually test the application by entering various income and expense scenarios.
   - Verify that the total budget is calculated correctly and displayed accurately on the UI.
   - Ensure that the income and expenses are stored and displayed correctly.
7. Documentation:
   - Include comments in your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
   - Provide a brief explanation of how to use the application in the README file.
8. Styling
   - Create a SASS variable called "primary-color" and assign it a hex-code color value of your choice. Use this variable to set the color of a heading element.
   - Write a SASS mixin called "gradient" that takes two colors as arguments and creates a linear gradient background. Use this mixin to set the background color of the webpage.
   - Add styles to make the application visually appealing and easy to use.
     \*Optional Styling Items:
     Create a SASS mixin called "animations" that generates keyframe animations based on a set of parameters like duration, easing, and keyframe rules. Use this mixin to create complex animations for different elements on a webpage.
     Create a design system with global variables for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements. Use these variables to create consistent styles in your project.
9. Hosting
   - Your site must be hosted on one of the following platforms: Vercel, AWS Amplify, GitHub Pages, or Netlify.
